                  <p>The common cold and flu are both contagious viral respiratory tract infections. While the symptoms of both can be similar, flu is much worse. A cold may drag you down a bit, but the flu can make you shudder at the very thought of getting out of bed.<br><br>

Congestion, sore throat, and sneezing are common with colds. Both cold and flu may bring coughing, headache, and chest discomfort. With the flu, though, you are likely to run a high fever for several days and have body aches, fatigue, and weakness. Symptoms of the flu also tend to come on abruptly. Usually, complications from colds are relatively minor, but a case of flu can lead to a life-threatening illness such as pneumonia.<br><br>

More than 100 types of cold viruses are known, and new strains of flu evolve every few years. Since both diseases are viral, antibiotics cannot conquer cold or flu. Remember: Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections.<br><br>

Here are some basic tips to help safeguard you, your family and your co-workers during common cold and flu season.<br>
</p><br>


              

               <ol>
                <li><b>Help maintain your immune system.</b><br>
                    A healthy immune system is the best protection against common cold and flu season. Keep your family's natural defenses strong with these simple tactics:<br><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>RELAX!</b>  Studies show that stress hampers your ability to stay healthy, especially during common cold and flu season, so anything you can do to combat stress helps fight germs. Take a mini meditation break during the day – simply close your eyes and focus on breathing in and out for a few minutes.  Get a massage.  Take up a hobby.  Whatever you can do to Relax.</li><br>

                        <li><b>SLEEP!</b>   When you consistently log seven to eight hours of sound sleep a night, your body has the chance to repair cells and maintain your immune system. Avoid alcohol before bed (it can interrupt REM sleep and leave you exhausted).</li><br>

                        <li><b>EAT!</b> Nutritious foods, such as a healthy variety of fruits and vegetables as part of a balanced diet, give your body the nutrients it needs.  Make sure to eat protein-rich foods throughout the day, especially fish, eggs and yogurt.</li><br>

                        <li><b>EXERCISE!</b>  CDC recommends 150 minutes of exercise each week, or about 30 minutes of moderate activity each day.  Regular exercise helps keep your immune system strong, making your white blood cells (they fight infections) travel through your body faster and do their job better).</li><br>

                        <li><b>GET YOUR FLU SHOTS!</b>  According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the single best way to prevent getting the flu is to get a flu shot each year. Flu vaccination can be an effective means of preventing infection, particularly for those over age 65, pregnant women, and anyone with a compromised immune system. If you have not yet received your flu shot, it’s not too late.  Your doctor or healthcare provider can offer advice on vaccination for your family against currently active strains of flu, and CVS (HBC’s prescription benefit manager) offers flu shots at most of their retail pharmacies.</li><br>

                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li><b>Fight germs.</b><br>

                    When you keep germs away during common cold and flu season, you can lower your risk of getting sick. Try these simple habits to help avoid stuffy noses and sore throats:<br><br>

                    <ul>
                                                
                        <li><b>WASH YOUR HANDS!</b>  A typical hand washing—before a meal, after going to the bathroom, or anytime you cough, sneeze, or blow your nose—should last 20 seconds.  </li><br>

                        <li><b>USE SANITIZERS!</b>  Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can help keep hands clean when soap and water are not available. Keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer with you to help keep your hands free of germs even when you’re on the go.  CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN!  Your desk can be a hot spot for germs at the office. Invest in some alcohol-based disinfectant wipes and clean your desk, keyboard, mouse, and phone frequently.</li><br>

                        <li><b>DON’T SHARE GERMS!</b>  Use tissues for coughs and sneezes, and dispense of them correctly.  Avoid touching your nose, mouth and eyes.  Avoid contact with people you know are ill.  Minimize touching in public areas (stair rails, water fountains).  Breathe out when in close contact with someone who is coughing or sneezing – until you are 6 – 10 feet out of the blast zone.</li><br>

                        <li><b>STAY HOME (if you need to)!  If you are sick, please don’t pass it on to others in your work, school or social environment.</b>  And avoid contact with people who may be at high risk (children, elderly, individuals with immune disorders). </li><br>

                    </ul>



                </li>
                <li><b>Be prepared.</b><br>

                Despite your best efforts, it can be tough to make it through cold and flu season without anyone in the family getting sick.<br><br>

                    <ul>
                        
                       <li><b>HYDRATE!</b>  Drink plenty of non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated liquids.  This will help wash germs and viruses out of your immune system.</li><br>

                       <li><b>STOCK UP.</b>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Keep daytime and night time cold medications in your medicine closet.</li>
                                <li>Have soups and herbal teas in your pantry.</li>
                                <li>Keep plenty of soft tissues available.</li>
                                <li>Make sure you have hand sanitizers readily available. </li>
                                
                            </ul>

                        
                       </li> 
  


                    </ul>

                </li>
                   



               </ol><br>

               <p>Even if you do catch a bug, you may be able to reduce the symptoms and shorten your illness if you follow these tips.</p>
