<p>Do you know what the #1 complication of pregnancy is? It isn’t high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, or early delivery—it’s depression. In fact, postpartum depression affects approximately 15-20% of new mothers, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). And this doesn’t account for the many more who suffer in silence. <br> <br>

When left untreated, postpartum depression can have a long-term effect on women’s lives and their families. Read on to learn more and get support. 


</p> <br>

<h3>Postpartum Depression vs.“The Baby Blues”</h3>


<p>In addition to being physically and mentally exhausted, your body goes through hormonal changes during and after pregnancy—leaving many women feeling down, anxious, or uncharacteristically irritable after giving birth. This is often called the “baby blues.” But the key difference is that baby blues tend to pass after a couple of weeks. Postpartum depression lasts longer and the symptoms tend to be more continuous and severe.</p> <br>

<h3>When it Occurs</h3>
<p>Postpartum depression can occur a few days or weeks after delivery, or set in as late as a year later. And while depression after birth is more commonly talked about, depression during pregnancy affects approximately 14 to 23% of women according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and can occur at any time during pregnancy.</p> <br>


<h3>Symptoms </h3>
<p>In addition to a depressed mood or anxiety, common symptoms of postpartum depression include difficulty bonding with your baby, excessive crying, insomnia or overwhelming fatigue, and a tendency to withdraw from family, friends, and activities you used to find pleasure in. But the symptoms aren’t one-mom-fits-all. Some describe a sense of emptiness, or purely physical symptoms—like intense headaches and body aches. <br> <br>

New mothers may also experience anxiety instead of (or in addition to) depression. Common symptoms of postpartum anxiety include excessive worrying (far beyond the common “am I doing this right?”), trouble sleeping, intrusive thoughts, or even paranoia. </p> <br>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Any woman can develop depression or anxiety during or after pregnancy. However, there are some factors that can increase risk. If you have a history of depression or anxiety or you’ve been through a particularly stressful event during the past year—like pregnancy complications, an illness, death in the family, or a job loss—you could have an increased risk. If you've had postpartum depression with a previous pregnancy, your odds of having it again after a future pregnancy are higher. You may also be at an increased risk if you have difficulty breastfeeding, lack a support system, or are dealing with financial issues during or after your pregnancy.</p> <br>



<h3>How to Get Support</h3>

<p>Perinatal and postpartum depression are nothing to be ashamed of and both are treatable. The sooner you seek help, the sooner you can start getting back to feeling like yourself. <br> <br>
