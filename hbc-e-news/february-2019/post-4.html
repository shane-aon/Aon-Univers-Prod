<h3>Did you know being kind has scientifically proven benefits?</h3><br>

<p>There are scientifically proven benefits to being kind! British researchers and authors John Ballatt and Penelope Campling catalogued the evidence for the impact kindness has on our brains.  They, and other researchers, found that individual acts of kindness release both endorphins and oxytocin, and create new neural connections.  They stated that kindness can become a self-reinforcing habit requiring less and less effort to exercise. <br><br>

Other studies have shown that, if you perform just one random act of kindness a day, you’ll not only reduce your stress, anxiety and depression, but also flood your body with the same hormones that that make you – and the person you helped – calmer, healthier and happier. </p><hr>

<h3>Did you also know that kindness is teachable?</h3>
<br>

<p>Happiness researcher Sean Achor demonstrated through his extensive research that if you perform random acts of kindness for two minutes a day for twenty-one days, you can actually retrain your brain to be more positive.  Studies such as his show that when your brain is more positive you are more likely to be creative, intelligent and productive. These attributes can spin into what we perceive as ‘quality of life’ attributes - job success, wealth, healthy relationships, and better health. <br><br>

<i>“It’s kind of like weight training, we found that people can actually build up their compassion ‘muscle’ and respond to others’ suffering with care and a desire to help.” Dr. Ritchie Davidson, University of Wisconsin</i></p><hr>

<h3>Or that kindness is contagious?</h3><br>

<p>The positive effects of kindness are experienced in the brain of everyone who witnessed the act, improving their mood and making them significantly more likely to “pay it forward.” This means one good deed in a crowded area can create a domino effect and improve the day of dozens of people!<br><br>

Every act of kindness creates a ripple effect that spreads from person to person with no end in sight. Kindness is contagious like a disease in which the outcome is divinely beautiful. Jamil Zaki, Professor of Psychology at Stanford University and Director of the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab recently conducted a series of studies that observe how witnessing kindness inspires kindness, causing it to spread like a virus. He concludes that “by emphasizing empathy-positive norms, we may be able to leverage the power of social influence to combat apathy and conflict in new ways.”</p><hr>

<h3>What can you do to be kind?</h3><br>

<p>According to Slovakian holocaust survivor Martin Kornfeld, “If we all do one random act of kindness daily, we just might set the world in the right direction”.  Let kindness start with you.  Here are a few thoughts to start with, but PLEASE ADD YOUR OWN.</p><br>

<p>Remember that there is no such thing as a small act of kindness.  <i>“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”</i>  Maya Angelou</p>
