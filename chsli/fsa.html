                <h4>Health Care Flexible Spending Account</h4>
                <p>The Health Care Flexible Spending Account offers a real tax savings advantage for your pocketbook. Many people find it a cost effective way to pay for such items as medical and dental plan deductibles/co-payments, eyeglasses, contact lenses, orthodontics and other health related expenses that are not covered by insurance. Even taxpayers who do not itemize their expenses can take advantage of this tax break using the Health Care Flexible Spending Account.<br><br>


                <!--Maximum annual contribution allowed by the IRS is $2,650 per participant.

                </p><br>


                <ul class="listc">
                  <li>IRS regulations state that expenses reimbursed under your Health Care FSA may not be reimbursed under any other plan or program. Only your out-of-pocket expenses are eligible.</li><br>
                  <li>Up to $500 may be rolled over for use in the next year. IRS requires that any unused money left in your account at the end of the year in excess of $500 be forfeited.</li><br>
                  <li>The amount you contribute to this account is not subject to federal, state, or Social Security (FICA) taxes.</li><br>
                  <li>Annual election is deducted in even increments from each paycheck and contributed to your Health Care FSA.</li><br>
                  <li>When a medical, dental, or prescription drug expense is incurred, the claim is automatically processed. Claims for other eligible expenses should be submitted manually. Please note: employees not enrolled in our medical, dental or prescription plan will have to submit their claims manually.</li><br>
                  <li>Services must be incurred within the plan year and must be claimed by March 31 of the following year.</li>

                </ul>
                <br>-->


                <h4>Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account </h4>
                <p>Extend your income by using the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account to pay for
                work-related dependent care expenses with income tax-free dollars. You can save a significant amount of money by participating in this account. If you are paying for day care expenses now, you are paying with taxable dollars and probably taking the federal tax credit at the end of the year. If you use the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account, you will pay these expenses with pre-tax dollars throughout the year, reducing the need to use the tax credit at the end of the year. In most instances, the savings realized through participation in the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account will be greater than the savings available through the tax credit.<br><br>

                These plans, as well as your entire health program, are intended and designed to be administered consistent with the tenets of the Catholic faith.<br><br></p>

                <h3>General Information</h3>
                
                <h4>Who Should Enroll?</h4>
                <p>The Health Care Flexible Spending Account is beneficial for anyone who has medically necessary out-of-pocket medical, dental, vision or hearing expenses beyond what their insurance plan covers. <br><br>The Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account is generally beneficial to anyone who has a qualified dependent and eligible day-care expenses.</p><br>


                <h4>Who is a Qualified Dependent?</h4>
                <p>Generally, if a person qualifies as your eligible dependent for medical benefits, he/she qualifies as a dependent under the Health Care Flexible Spending Account.<br><br>

                (See <a href="enrollment-eligibility.html">Enrollment Eligbility</a> page for a list of eligible dependents.)<br><br>

                Under the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account, dependents are defined as children up until their 13th birthday or children 13 or over who are physically or mentally unable to care for themselves. A spouse or elderly parent residing in your home, who is physically or mentally unable to care for himself or herself, also qualifies.</p><br>


                <h4>Do I have to re-enroll during every open enrollment period?</h4>
                <p>Yes. The IRS requires that employees make new selections for each and every plan year. The process of enrolling is detailed in your enrollment materials. Regardless of the enrollment process adopted by your company, it is important to review your expenses each year to make sure that your selection is appropriate, based on the actual expenses you expect to have.</p><br>
