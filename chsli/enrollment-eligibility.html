              <h2>When To Make Changes</h2>
              <p>Once you have made your enrollment choices, you generally cannot make any changes until the next annual open enrollment period. However, you may make certain changes if you have a qualified status change or another permitted election change. <br><br>
              If you have a qualified status change, you must contact your Human Resources representative within 31 days of the event. You must also send in documentation with proof of the event (i.e. proof of gain/loss of other insurance, marriage certificate, death certificate, etc.). Note: Newborns are NOT automatically added to your coverage.</p><br>


              <h3>Qualified status changes and other permitted election changes include, but are not limited to:</h3>
              <ul class="listn">

                  <li>Your legal marital status changes.</li>
                  <li>You increase or decrease your number of dependents (birth, death, adoption or<br>
                  placement for adoption).</li>
                  <li>Your dependent child is no longer eligible for coverage according to the terms of the plan(s) (exceeds age limitations). Our medical plans cover dependent children until the end of the year in which they turn age 26. Our dental plans cover dependent children until the end of the year in which they turn age 25.</li>
                  <li>A court decree orders that you must provide health coverage for your dependent.</li>
                  <li>Coverage under your spouse’s plan is significantly curtailed or ceases.</li>
                  <li>You, your spouse, or your dependent child begin or terminate employment, or your spouse or dependent child switches from full-time or part-time employment (or vice versa) and you, your spouse and/ or dependent child becomes or ceases to be eligible for coverage.</li>
                  <li>You switch from full-time to part-time employment (or vice versa). Benefit changes become effective the first of the month following this type of change.</li>
                  <li>Your spouse or dependent child(ren), who formerly was not a resident of the United States, arrives in the United States.</li>
