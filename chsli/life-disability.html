           <h4>Basic Life Insurance</h4>
           <p>This is offered to all benefit eligible employees at no cost. This benefit is equal to your annual base salary, rounded to the next higher $1,000. The minimum amount of basic coverage is $20,000 if you’re a benefit eligible full-time employee, or $5,000 if you’re a benefit eligible part-time employee.<br><br>

          You’re automatically covered for an additional benefit equal to your basic life insurance coverage in case of accidental death, loss of limb, or eyesight. While CHS pays the full cost of this coverage, amounts in excess of $50,000 will be subject to imputed income tax. That means the premium for coverage over $50,000 will be reported as taxable income to you.
          <br><br>

          Your Basic Life and Accidental Death & Dismemberment coverage will be reduced upon reaching age 70, and again at 75, 80, and 85. Premiums are calculated on the reduced amount of coverage.</p><hr>

          <h4>Supplemental Life Insurance for You</h4>
          <p>You may elect supplemental life insurance in the amount of 1 to 6 times your annual base salary. If you’re currently enrolled in supplemental life insurance, during each year’s open enrollment, you may elect additional supplemental life insurance equal to 1 time more than you currently have, without proof of good health, provided that it does not exceed 3 times your annual base salary or $500,000 when combined with your basic employee life insurance. If you’re not currently enrolled in supplemental life insurance, any election you make during open enrollment will require proof of good health.</p><br>

          <h6>Life Insurance Maximums</h6>

          <p>You will need to provide proof of good health for the following:</p>

          <ul class="listc">
              
              <li>Basic life insurance in excess of
$500,000 up to the maximum benefit
of $650,000.</li>
              <li>Combined basic life insurance and
supplemental life insurance in excess of
$500,000 up to the maximum benefit
of $1,500,000.</li>
              <li>Any time you elect more than 3
times your salary in supplemental life
insurance, regardless of whether you are
over the maximum.</li>
 

          </ul><br>

          <h6>Supplemental Life Insurance for Your Dependents</h6>
          <p>You also may enroll your eligible dependents for coverage under one of the following life insurance plans:</p>

          <ul class="listc">
            <li>Spouse Life Insurance: Your spouse may be insured for $5,000, $20,000, $50,000, $100,000, or $150,000. Spouses cannot elect an amount exceeding 100% of the employee’s combined basic and supplemental life amount.</li>
            <li>Child Life Insurance: Children are eligible from 14 days old, or until the end of the year in which they turn age 26 regardless of student status. Children ages 26 and older are eligible if they are disabled, unmarried and financially dependent on you. You may elect to insure your child(ren) for $4,000 or $10,000.</li>
          </ul><br>

          <p><b>Please note that if both you and your spouse are CHS employees, you may not cover your spouse as a dependent, nor may they cover you as a dependent. Children may only be covered by one family member who is an employee of CHS.</b></p><hr>

          <h4>Short Term Disability</h4>
          <p>STD coverage continues part of your pay for up to 26 weeks if you are ill or injured and unable to work. This plan pays a benefit of up to 50% of your covered earnings – to a weekly maximum of $170. Benefit eligibility begins on the eighth calendar day of disability, subject to medical documentation. Contact your Human Resources representative for additional information.</p><hr>

          <h4>Supplemental Short Term Disability </h4>
          <p>The Voluntary Supplemental Short Term Disability insurance program provides additional income replacement, beyond the New York State Disability plan, in the event you are unable to work due to a non-work related illness or injury. Following the waiting period (7days for sickness, 7 days for accident), the plan provides a benefit equal to an additional $100 per week or $200 per week of income, depending upon your election, less income you may receive from other sources. The benefit continues as long as you are disabled, up to a maximum of 26 weeks. Depending on where you work within the CHS system, this benefit may or may not be available to you.<br><br> </i> </p><hr>

          <h4>Long Term Disability (LTD)</h4>
          <p>LTD coverage can help protect your income if a major illness or injury prevents you from working for an extended period of time. If you are disabled and unable to perform your job, LTD payments begin after 26 weeks. LTD benefits will be offset by any amount you are eligible to receive from other sources, such as Social Security or Workers’ Compensation.</p>

                      <h4>What insurance coverages are provided by my employer?<h4>
                      <p>At no cost to you, your employer provides Basic Life Insurance and Basic Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Insurance in an amount equal to 1 times your basic annual earnings, to a maximum of $500,000 without providing proof of good health satisfactory to The Prudential Insurance Company of America, or $650,000 with proof of good health satisfactory to The Prudential Insurance Company of America. You are automatically enrolled for these coverages. Life Insurance pays a benefit if you die for any covered reason; AD&D Insurance pays an additional benefit if you are seriously injured or die due to a covered accident.<br><br>

                      The Booklet-Certificate includes definitions, a complete list of covered AD&D losses, as well as information on other enhancements and benefits.</p><br>

                      <h4>Is Supplemental coverage available for my spouse?</h4>

                        <p><small>* Applies to initial enrollment only</small></p><br>

                      <h4>Can I purchase coverage for my children?</h4>
                        <p>You may choose to purchase guaranteed Supplemental Life Insurance coverage of $4,000 or $10,000 for each child.

                       <p>Coverage will end upon your termination of employment or as specified in the Booklet-Certificate. At that time, you may convert your group life insurance to an individual life insurance policy insured by The Prudential Insurance Company of America.<br><br>

                        In addition, you can continue the Supplemental Life Insurance coverage for your spouse and children through a portability provision subject to the plan’s specifications.</p><br>


                       <h4>What is the Accelerated Benefit Option?</h4> 
                       <p>If you are terminally ill, the Accelerated Benefit Option lets you receive part of the group term life insurance death benefit (a discounted amount may apply) while still living. You must have a life expectancy of six months or fewer. You can use the proceeds as you wish for items such as medical
                      expenses, family expenses, or travel, and take a distribution in a lump sum payment or monthly installments. The group life death benefit will be reduced by the amount of Accelerated Benefit Option payment. Some provisions may vary depending on state regulations. Please see the Booklet-Certificate for details specific to CHS’s plan.</p><br>


                      <h4>Do I still pay insurance premiums if I become disabled?</h4>
                      <p>Payment of premium can be waived if you are totally disabled for six months, you are less than 60 years old when the disability begins, and you continue to be totally disabled. This waiver terminates at age 65. Please refer to the Booklet-Certificate for details. This option does not apply to AD&D Insurance.</p><br>

                      <h4>Important Details</h4>

                    <h4>What is Short term disability Insurance?</h4>
                    <p>If you suffer a covered disability while insured by this plan, you’ll receive monetary benefits designed to help you maintain your normal lifestyle. This program covers disabling injuries or sicknesses that last beyond the benefit waiting period, whether they occur on or off the job.<br></p><br>

                    <h4>What is the definition of disability?</h4>
                    <p>To receive benefits under this plan, you must be disabled (as defined below) as a result of a covered injury or sickness, and you must be under the appropriate care of a licensed, practicing physician who is qualified to treat your disability.<br><br>

                    Disabled means that, solely because of a covered injury or sickness, you are unable to perform the material duties of your regular occupation and you are unable to earn 80% or more of your indexed covered earnings. Injury means any accidental loss or bodily harm that result directly and independently of all other causes from an accident. Sickness means any physical or mental illness.</p><br>

                    <h4>Eligibility</h4>
                    <p>You are eligible if you are an active employee who works the minimum hours required per week on a regularly scheduled basis.</p><br>

                    <h4>How long do I have to wait before benefits are paid?</h4>
                    <p>Before collecting benefits, you must satisfy an elimination period following your date of disability. For your plan, this period is the later of any accumulated sick leave or 7 days of continuous disability from either accident or sickness.</p><br>

                    <h4>How long will my disability payments continue?</h4>
                    <p>Once you qualify for benefits under this plan, you continue to receive them until the end of the 26 weeks benefit period, or until you no longer qualify for benefits, whichever occurs first. (The Prudential Life Insurance Company will ask you to periodically furnish proof of your continuing disability.)</p><br>


                    <h4>If I am disabled can the benefit amount be reduced?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. Your weekly Short term disability benefit may be reduced by any other income you receive.</p><br>

                    <h4> What is Long term disability Insurance?</h4>
                    <p>If you suffer a covered disability while insured by this plan, you’ll receive monetary benefits designed to help you maintain your normal lifestyle. This program covers disabling injuries or sicknesses that last beyond the benefit waiting period, whether they occur on or off the job.</p><br>


                    <h4>What is the definition of disability?</h4>
                    <p>To receive benefits under this plan, you must be disabled (as defined below) as a result of a covered injury or sickness, and you must be under the appropriate care of a licensed, practicing physician who is qualified to treat your disability. <br><br>

                    Disabled means that, solely because of a covered injury or sickness, you are unable to perform the material duties of your regular occupation and you are unable to earn 80% or more of your indexed covered earnings.<br><br>

                    After benefits have been payable for 24 months, you are considered disabled if your injury or sickness makes you unable to perform all the material duties of any occupation for which you are (or may reasonably become) qualified by education, training or experience, and you are unable to earn 80% or more of your indexed covered earnings.<br><br>

                    Injury means any accidental loss or bodily harm. Sickness means any physical or mental illness.</p><br>


                    <h4>Eligibility</h4>
                    <p>You are eligible if you are an active employee who works the minimum hours required per week on a regularly scheduled basis.</p><br>


                    <h4>What coverage is available?</h4>
                    <p>This plan pays a benefit of up to 60% of your monthly covered earnings – to a maximum of $10,000 per month.<br><br>

                    Your benefit amount will be reduced by any amounts payable to you by any sources listed under the “Effects of Other Income Benefits” section. Your benefit amounts will also be reduced if you are not working and it is determined by independent medical specialists that you could work to your level of optimum ability.<br><br>

                    Covered earnings means your wages or salary, excluding overtime pay, bonuses, commissions and other extra compensation.</p><br>


                    <h4>When can I enroll?</h4>
                    <p>You can enroll any time within 31 days following the date you become eligible for coverage. If you decide to enroll later, you will have to provide acceptable evidence of good health. This may require a medical examination.</p><br>


                    <h4>When is the plan effective?</h4>
                    <p>If you meet these eligibility requirements, your coverage takes effect on the later of the program’s effective date, the date you become eligible, the date we receive your completed enrollment form, or the date you authorize any necessary payroll deductions.<br><br>

                    If you have to submit evidence of good heath, your coverage takes effect on the date The Prudential Life Insurance Company agrees, in writing, to cover you. If you’re not actively at work on the date your coverage would otherwise take effect, you’ll be covered on the date you return to work.</p><br>


                    <h4>How long do I have to wait before benefits are paid?</h4>
                    <p>Before collecting benefits, you must satisfy an elimination period following your date of disability. For your plan, this period is 180 days of continuous disability.</p><br>


                    <h4>How long will my disability payments continue?</h4>
                    <p>Once you qualify for benefits under this plan, you continue to receive them until the end of the benefit period, or until you no longer qualify for benefits, whichever occurs first. (The Prudential Life Insurance Company will ask you to periodically furnish proof of your continuing disability).</p><br>


                    <h4>If I already have disability coverage, do I have to do anything?</h4>
                    <p>If you already have disability coverage and wish to maintain the same coverage, you do not have to do anything.</p><br>


                    <h4>What if I have disability coverage and would like to increase my coverage; or if I do not have coverage and would like to apply for coverage?</h4>
                    <p>You must fill out a new enrollment form if you’d like to request coverage for the first time, or if you’d like to increase your existing coverage. Any new requested coverage amounts for all eligible employees are subject to Evidence of Insurability.</p><br>

                    </ul><br>

                    <h4>Maximum Benefit Period</h4>
                    <p>This is the maximum length of time for which the plan will pay Disability Benefits to a disabled employee. Benefit payments may end earlier if you no longer qualify under the terms or conditions of this policy.</p><br>


                    <h4>Pre-Existing Conditions</h4>
                    <p>Pre-existing conditions are defined as any injury or sickness for which you have incurred expenses, received medical treatment, care or services including diagnostic measures, took prescribed drugs or medicines, or for which a reasonable person would have consulted a physician prior to the most recent effective date of insurance. This limitation will apply to any added benefits or increases in benefits.<br><br>

                    Disability Benefits will not be paid if the disability results from pre-existing conditions until you have been disabled for the number of months specified in your policy. Except for any benefits in excess of a prior plan’s coverage, you will receive credit if you have fulfilled all or a part of your previous group disability plan’s pre-existing condition requirement immediately </p><br>

                    If you are approached as a suitable candidate for a Rehabilitation Plan and refuse such assistance, Disability Benefits will not be payable until you agree to participate in our rehabilitation efforts.<br><br>

                    A Rehabilitation Plan is a written plan designed to enable you to return to work. It can consist of
                    educational, vocational, physical rehabilitation or other services as well as work including modified and part-time work.</p><br>

                    <h4>Return to Work Incentive Benefit</h4>
                    <p>To enable you to return to work on a limited- duty or part-time basis while receiving Disability Benefits under this plan, a Work Incentive Benefit has been included.<br><br>

                    If you are disabled and return to work in a limited capacity while receiving Disability Benefits, you may continue to receive benefits. During the first 24 months that monthly benefits are payable, benefits would only be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that the combination of this plan’s benefit, work earnings and Other Income Benefits do not exceed 100% of the individual’s pre-disability Covered Earnings.<br><br>

                    After the first 24 months, benefits payable under this plan are reduced by 50% of your current earnings received during any month you works. Benefits would be further reduced, if necessary, to the extent required to ensure that the combination of plan benefits, work earnings and Other Income Benefits do not exceed 80% of your Indexed Covered Earnings.<br><br>

                    Work Incentive Benefits are payable for the Maximum Benefit Period or until you no longer qualifies for these benefits.</p><br>
