         <h4>Enrolling or Making Changes</h4>
           
          <p>
            Many events in your work or personal life can impact your benefits. Several of the benefit programs require that you enroll within a specified period of time.<br><br>To find out when you will be eligible to enroll in benefits,<a href="../when-to-enroll/index.html" target="_blank"> click here</a>.<br>

          <h4> Newly Hired Employees </h4>
        <u><h5>31 Days from Date of Eligibility</h5></u>
        
        
       
       <p>
         If you are a newly hired employee, you have 31 days from the date you are eligible to make your benefit enrollment elections. During this time period, you should decide which benefits meet your needs 
(health, dental, and any other insurance plans), and determine if you want to enroll in a flexible spending account (FSA). If you miss your deadline, then your next opportunity to enroll in benefits is during the Annual Benefits Enrollment period or if you experience a qualifying life event.
<!--You also have 31 days from your eligibility date to make decisions on benefits. You will not be able 
to enroll until the next Annual Benefits Enrollment period. If you later wish to enroll in these benefits, you must provide Evidence of Insurability (EOI).--><br>

  <a href="../../docs/Inspira EOI Form.pdf" target="_blank"><button style="margin-top:8px;" class="btn btn-responsive">EOI Form </button></a>

       </p><hr>
         
        <h4>Annual Benefits Enrollment</h4>
          <p>Each year, we offer an Annual Benefits Enrollment period, during which you can enroll in, or make changes to, your benefits. Employees will be notified of an upcoming Annual Benefits Enrollment period before it begins. Even if you fail to enroll as a newly hired employee and do not experience a qualifying life event, you may enroll during the next Annual Benefits Enrollment period. </p><hr>



       <h4>Qualifying Life Events </h4>
       <h5><u>31 Days From Date of Event</u></h5>
       <p>If you experience a qualifying life event, you may make changes to your benefits within 31 days of the event. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) states that eligible employees may make elections to the plan only once a year; annual enrollment benefit choices are binding through March 31st. The following special circumstances are some of the reasons you may change your benefits during the plan year:</p>

       <ul class="listc">
         
        <li>Marriage, divorce, legal separation</li>
        <li>Birth or adoption (or placement of adoption) of a child</li>
        <li>Death of a covered dependent</li>
        <li>Loss or gain of group insurance coverage for yourself or a covered dependent</li>
        <li>Termination or commencement of your spouse’s coverage, in general, when coverage is maintained through your spouse’s plan</li>
        <li>Shift from part-time to full-time status (or vice versa) by you or your spouse</li>
        <li>Shift from per diem or flex to part-time or full-time status (or vice versa) by you or your spouse</li>
        <li>When a dependent satisfies or ceases to satisfy eligibility requirements</li>
        <li>Taking an unpaid leave of absence (you or your spouse)</li>
        <li>Gain or loss of eligibility for Medicaid or a Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or for a premium assistance subsidy under these programs (60-day election period)</li>
        <li>A residence or worksite change that impacts health care coverage</li>

       </ul>  <br>

       <p>If you experience a qualifying life event and would like to update your benefits, you must report the qualifying life event within 31 calendar days of the event and provide the appropriate documentation. Documentation may include a birth, marriage, or death certificate, divorce decree, or proof of loss or gain of coverage.</p>
<br>
      <center> <a href="https://www.myinspirabenefits.org/index.php/login/" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-responsive">Click here to report a qualifying life event </button></a><br><br></center><br>

      <h4>Reporting Qualifying Life Events:</h4>
      <p>The 31-calendar day deadline is a critical factor toward successfully completing a qualifying life event change. If you do not report the qualifying life event and provide the requested documentation within 31 calendar days of the event (unless otherwise noted), you will not be eligible to make changes until the next Annual Benefits Enrollment period.</p><br><br><br>
