                                        <li>You can purchase coverage for yourself, your spouse, and your children.
                                  </li>
                                        <li>No physical exams are required to apply for coverage up to a certain amount during an enrollment period.

                                        <li>As the policy builds cash value, you can eventually use it to make premium payments or to pay urgent expenses while you are still living.

                                        <li>You can take your policy with you if you leave the company or retire.

                                  the policy as long as you make the payments, which means the premiums will not go up. (Initial cost varies based on age, coverage level and tobacco use.)</li>

All employees can enroll in Voluntary Short-Term Disability Insurance. For New Jersey residents, you may elect a benefit amount of up to 40% of your annual income. For residents of Pennsylvania and Delaware, you may elect benefit amounts up to 60% of your annual income.

    <p>Out-of-pocket costs of a serious illness can be catastrophic, even if you have medical insurance. Critical Illness Insurance pays a lump sum benefit directly to you if you are diagnosed with a covered condition. You use this money however you choose—deductibles and coinsurance, expenses your family incurs to be by your side, or simply to replace your lost earnings from being out of work. <br><br>You choose the benefit amount when you enroll—from $10,000 up to $50,000 (in $5,000 increments).  The premium you pay is based on the benefit amount you choose and whether or not you use tobacco.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>Covered Illnesses Include:</h5>

    <ul class="listc">
      <li>Heart Attack</li>
      <li>Stroke</li>
      <li>Major Organ Transplant</li>
      <li>End Stage Renal (Kidney) Failure</li>
      <li>Cancer</li>
      <li>Carcinoma in Situ*</li>
      <li>Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery*</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p><small><i>*The coverage pays 25% of the face amount of the policy once per lifetime for coronary artery bypass surgery and carcinoma in situ.</i></small></p><br>

   <h5>Plan Features</h5>   

      <ul class="listc">
        <li>You do not have to be terminally ill to receive benefits.</li>
        <li>Coverage options are available for your spouse and children as riders to your coverage. If you choose to add spouse and/or children coverage to your Critical Illness plan, they will receive 50% of the benefit amount shown for you, the employee, if they were to suffer a critical illness.</li>
        <li>A Wellness Benefit is included, which pays a benefit once per calendar year to the insured individual  if a covered health screening test is performed (blood tests, stress tests, colonoscopies, chest X-rays, mammograms, etc.).**</li>
        <li>Coverage is portable—you can take your policy with you if you change jobs or retire.</li>

      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>Visit the enrollment website or speak with a benefits counselor for help calculating the cost of the benefit, which will vary depending upon your age, tobacco use, and the amount of coverage you elect.<br><br>

    <p>Accidents happen. You can’t always prevent them, but you can take steps to reduce the financial impact, which is often substantial. Voluntary Accident Insurance can help cover the out-of-pocket medical expenses and extra bills that can follow an accident. <br><br>

    The total benefit you receive is based on the type of injury, its severity, and the medical services you received in treatment and recovery.<br><br>

    The plan pays benefits for a variety of injuries and accident-related expenses, including:</p>



    <ul class="listc">
      <li>Hospitalization</li>
      <li>Emergency room treatment</li>
      <li>Fractures</li>
      <li>Physical therapy</li>
      <li>Transportation</li>
      <li>Dislocations</li>
    </ul><br>

   <h5>Plan Features</h5>   

      <ul class="listc">
        <li>Benefits are paid for accidents that occur on and off the job.
</li>
        <li>You can also elect to cover your spouse and children.
</li>
        <li>There are no health questions or physical exams required.</li>
        <li>Coverage is individually owned, which means you can take your policy with you if you change jobs or retire.</li>

    <h4>Permanent Life Insurance</h4>


    <p>Permanent Life Insurance is an indi-vidual life insurance policy that can also build cash value you can utilize while you are still living. At an affordable premium, you can have the added financial protection you and your family may need during times of uncertainty. </p>
    <br>

    <h5>Plan Features </h5>

    <ul class="listc">
      <li>You can purchase coverage for yourself, your spouse, and your children.
</li>
      <li>No physical exams are required to apply for coverage up to a certain amount during an enrollment period.
</li>
      <li>As the policy builds cash value, you can eventually use it to make premium payments or to pay urgent expenses while you are still living.
</li>
      <li>You can take your policy with you if you leave the company or retire.
</li>
      <li>Permanent Life Insurance never expires. You keep
the policy as long as you make the payments, which means the premiums will not go up. (Initial cost varies based on age, coverage level and tobacco use.)</li>
    </ul><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-disability" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-profile-tab">
    

    <h4> Short-Term Disability Insurance</h4>


    <p>Short Term Disability pays a portion of your salary if an illness or injury keeps you out of work. This source of income may help you maintain your household and living expenses until you get back to work. <br><br>
Most employees under age 70 can enroll in Voluntary Short-Term Disability Insurance. For New Jersey residents, you may elect a benefit amount of up to 40% of your annual income. For residents of Pennsylvania and Delaware, you may elect benefit amounts up to 60% of your annual income. Benefits become payable after seven consecutive days of illness or off-the-job injury and continue for a maximum duration of 26 weeks. You become eligible to enroll in this benefit on your date of hire. </p>

        <h4>Critical Illness Insurance</h4>


    <p>Out-of-pocket costs of a serious illness can be catastrophic, even if you have medical insurance. Critical Illness Insurance pays a lump sum benefit directly to you if you are diagnosed with a covered condition. You use this money however you choose—deductibles and coinsurance, expenses your family incurs to be by your side, or simply to replace your lost earnings from being out of work. <br><br>You choose the benefit amount when you enroll—from $10,000 up to $50,000 (in $5,000 increments).  The premium you pay is based on the benefit amount you choose and whether or not you use tobacco.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>Covred Illnesses Include:</h5>

    <ul class="listc">
      <li>Heart Attack</li>

      <li>Carcinoma in Situ*</li>
      <li>Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery*</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p><small><i>*The coverage pays 25% of the face amount of the policy once per lifetime for coronary artery bypass surgery and carcinoma in situ.</i></small></p><br>

   <h5>Plan Features</h5>   

      <ul class="listc">
        <li>You do not have to be terminally ill to receive benefits.</li>
        <li>Coverage options are available for your spouse and children as riders to your coverage.</li>
        <li>A Wellness Benefit is included, which pays a benefit once per calendar year to the insured individual  if a covered health screening test is performed (blood tests, stress tests, colonoscopies, chest X-rays, mammograms, etc.).**</li>
        <li>Coverage is portable—you can take your policy with you if you change jobs or retire.</li>

      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>Visit the enrollment website or speak with a benefits counselor for help calculating the cost of the benefit, which will vary depending upon your age, tobacco use, and the amount of coverage you elect.<br><br>

        <small><i>**Wellness Benefit may not be available in all states. 
The policy or its provisions may vary or be unavailable in some states. The policy has exclusions and limitations which may affect any benefits payable.</i></small>

    <h4>Accident Insurance</h4>


    <p>Accidents happen. You can’t always prevent them, but you can take steps to reduce the financial impact, which is often substantial. Voluntary Accident Insurance can help cover the out-of-pocket medical expenses and extra bills that can follow an accident. <br><br>

    The total benefit you receive is based on the type of injury, its severity, and the medical services you received in treatment and recovery.<br><br>

      <li>Hospitalization</li>

      <li>Fractures</li>
      <li>Physical therapy</li>
      <li>Transportation</li>
      <li>Dislocations</li>
    </ul><br>

   <h5>Plan Features</h5>   

      <ul class="listc">
        <li>• Benefits are paid for accidents that occur on and off the job.
</li>
        <li>• You can also elect to cover your spouse and children.
</li>
        <li>There are no health questions or physical exams required.</li>
        <li>Coverage is individually owned, which means you can take your policy with you if you change jobs or retire.</li>
