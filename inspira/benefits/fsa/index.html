                  <p>Inspira Health can help you create accounts to pay for eligible medical or daycare expenses. You fund Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) by setting aside part of your pay—before taxes—through payroll deduction. If you can estimate your expenses for the coming year, this can be a good way to save on your taxes each year.</p> <hr>
              
        
            <h4>How FSAs work</h4>

                           <p>There are two kinds of FSAs:</p><br>

                      
          <ul class="listc">
              <li style="font-weight: bold;color:#1ea9e8;font-size: 16px;">Health Care FSA
</li>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;color:#1ea9e8;font-size: 16px;">Dependent Care FSA (daycare expenses)</li>

          </ul>
          <br>
                      
               <p>Each pay period, your money accumulates in any FSAs you elect. You can use these FSA funds to pay for eligible expenses throughout the year using an FSA debit card, just like any other bank account. In the case of a Health Care FSA, you can use your funds at any time throughout the year; for a Dependent Care FSA, you may only use funds you have already set aside.</p><hr>

                    <h5>How much money should you put into an FSA each pay period?</h5>
                    <p>That depends on your expenses. The best way to estimate your expenses for the year is by looking over the eligible expenses you incurred over the past few years. Divide your expected expenses by the number of pay periods in the year. Consider contributing this amount each pay period to an FSA. Estimate carefully: unused funds are lost at the end of the year. You have until June 15 to incur expenses using funds remaining in your FSAs from the previous year, and you can file for reimbursement for those expenses until June 30.</p><hr>
                    <h5>HSA Plan Enrollees: the Limited Use Medical FSA</h5>
                    <p>Due to federal guidelines, participants in the HSA Plan are not eligible to enroll in both a traditional Health Care FSA and an HSA. However, enrollees in the HSA Plan may open a Limited Use Medical FSA (as well as a Dependent Care FSA). <br>
<br>
                    Initially, you may use a Limited Use Medical FSA for eligible dental and vision care expenses only. Once you reach your deductible, you may use the FSA to cover medical expenses, as well. You must submit documentation that states your annual deductible has been met. <br><br>

                    <span class="lb">To participate in an FSA, you must renew your election before the start of each plan year (April 1).</span></p><hr>

                      <h5>FSA Reimbursement Deadlines</h5>

                    <ul class="listc">
                      <li> You have until June 15  to use any FSA funds remaining from the previous year. Any money not spent will be lost.</li><br>
                      <li> You have until June 30 to file for reimbursement from FSA funds from the previous year. After this date you may only be reimbursed from the current year's FSA funds.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h4>FSA Tax Savings Example</h4>
                        <p>By anticipating your family’s medical and dependent care costs, you can use FSAs to lower your taxable income. Your lower taxes translate to more spendable income. Here’s an example: </p>

                                    <h5>How It Works</h5>
                                       <p>Your Benny card makes using your FSA dollars easy. By using your card at eligible providers and merchants, you are immediately reimbursed for qualified health care and dependent care expenses. </p><br>
                                     <h5>Always Save Your Receipts</h5>  
                                        <p>Save your receipts for eligible health care and dependent care expenses, even when using your Benny card. While pharmacies and other merchants can automatically verify many eligible purchases, health care providers usually cannot. For this reason, we recommend you keep receipts for all FSA transactions, including doctor’s office copays.</p><br>
