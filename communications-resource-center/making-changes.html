Make a list of internal and external factors and announcements—like record earnings and flat merit pay increases while you’re rolling out only high-deductible medical plan options for the first time. Then position your benefits change in the broader context, and prepare for worse case scenarios and potential media stories.

This step will significantly reduce the amount of rework and out-of-control versions once you start writing the actual communication materials. Plus, disciplining yourself to create clear, succinct messages will help you fully understand all the nuances of the change early on.</td>

There’s one common reason for these failures: leaders did not visibly and actively involve themselves in the change initiative from start to finish.* Prepare both leaders and managers to understand, support, and communicate the basics of the change. Equipping them to share information openly and honestly will increase trust and increase the likelihood that your key messages are communicated clearly and accurately.</td>

With manager approval, ask a group of employees affected by the change to sign a confidentiality agreement and give input on your messaging and drafts. You can also ask this group to share real-time feedback during and after the rollout. Log their input and questions so you keep a pulse on whether you need to communicate more about certain topics.</td>

Creating a few excellent resources—filled with your key messages and delivered through your most effective channels—will yield better results than trying to do too much and losing the continuity.

Address the emotional aspect of the change. Then share the logical rationale and examples of how others have navigated the change.
