     How To Enroll
</h4>    
        
        
        <p>
         Enrollment instructions vary depending on location. See your enrollment packet or check with your HR representative for details for your location.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <b>What You'll Need</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="listc">
          <li>Your Associate ID number and badge</li>
          <li>Your date of birth and Social Security number</li>
          <li>Marriage certificates or birth certificates for any dependents with a different last name than yours</li>
          <li>Social Security numbers for any dependents you plan to enroll</li>
          <li>Beneficiary information</li>

         <!-- Once your enrollment is complete, you may log on to <a href="http://www.benefitsgo.com/perdue/" target="blank">www.benefitsgo.com/perdue</a> to review your personalized benefits confirmation statement approximately 48 hours after your session.-->
         Once your enrollment is completed, be sure to review your personalized benefits confirmation statement.

        <h4>
          WAIVE OPTION
        </h4>
        <p>
         You have the option to decline benefit coverage, if you prefer. If you choose not to participate in Open Enrollment (for example, by not meeting with a benefits counselor), by default you will be considered declining your coverage for 2019.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <b>As with your other choices, this remains in effect
for the entire plan year, unless you have an approved change in your work or family status.</b>
        </p><br>

        <h4>BENEFIT CHANGES OUTSIDE OPEN ENROLLMENT</h4>
        <p>Your elections during Open Enrollment will remain in effect for the entire plan year unless you have an approved change in work or family status. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;text-decoration: underline;">Associates must notify Human Resources no later than 30 days</span> after loss of other coverage and/or change in family status (such as marriage, divorce, birth or adoption of children) in order to make changes to your plan.<br><br>

        In addition, if you are declining enrollment for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance or group health plan coverage, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents in the Perdue Health Plan if you or your dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stopped contributing towards your or your dependents' other coverage). However, you must request enrollment within 30 days after your or your dependents' other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributing toward the other coverage).  
        </p><br>
        
        
        
        
        <h4>
    Your Eligibility
        </h4>
        <p>
          You are eligible for benefits if you are a full-time associate working 30 or more hours per week and have satisfied your benefits waiting period.
        </p><br>
        
        <h4>
          Dependent Eligibility
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Your eligible dependents may include:</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="listc">
          <li>Your legal opposite-sex or same-sex spouse (unless you are legally separated)</li>
          <li>Your children up to age 26, regardless of marital or student status, even if they are eligible for other insurance coverage.* </li>
          <li>Your children over age 26 who are physically or mentally disabled may be eligible (see Summary Plan Description for more details)</li>
          <li>Individuals who are neither your spouse nor child(ren) whereby you have legal guardianship</li>
        </ul><br>


        <p>*“Children” include your natural children, stepchildren, children under your legal guardianship and legally
          adopted children. A child may still qualify for coverage
          even though he or she does not reside in your household
          if you are divorced.</p><br>
        
        <p>
          <b> Dependent Documentation Requirements:</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="listc">
          <li>Birth certificates are required for newborns and dependents with a different last name than yours.</li>
          <li>Statements of Eligibility are required for disabled children.</li>
          <li>A marriage certificate is required for a spouse with a different last name than yours.</li>
          <li>Social Security numbers are required for all dependents.</li>
          <li>Court orders are required for dependents who are under your guardianship.</li>
          <li>Dates of birth are required for all dependents.</li>
        </ul><br>
        
        <p>
        
Only those dependents meeting the eligibility requirements can enroll for coverage. Check with your benefits counselor or your local Human Resources department for more information regarding dependent eligibility.
          
        </p><br>

        <p><b><i>Note: Coverage will not be provided to any dependent who has not provided proper documentation per the requirements above.</i></b></p><br>
        
        <h4>
          Social Security Numbers
        </h4>
        <p>
        While the penalty for failing to obtain qualifying health coverage in 2019 has been reduced to zero, Perdue must still report to the IRS on the health coverage it offers. As part of this reporting, Perdue is required to provide Social Security Numbers to the IRS and issue a 1095-C statement to you. As such, Perdue requests the Social Security numbers for yourself and each dependent you plan to enroll in the Perdue Health Plan.
