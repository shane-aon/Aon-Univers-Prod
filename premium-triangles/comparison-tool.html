              <p>Gary is generally healthy, and only visits his physician once aside from his annual physical/wellness exam. His cost of care for the year is $220, because the annual physical is at no-cost.</p>
              <p>If Gary chooses the Essential 20 or Advantage 10 Plan, Gary will spend nothing out of pocket, because he will be able to use the Galaxy contribution to his HSA to cover his medical costs. Gary will even have $280 remaining in his HSA for future health care costs. However, because of its low premiums, the HDHP Plan Plan is the lowest-cost plan in this scenario, even though Gary will have some Out of Pocket costs.</p>

              <p> Gary has type 2 diabetes, a condition that requires regular doctor visits, tests and insulin treatment. The cost of his treatment adds $4,000 to his standard medical expenses. </p>
              <p>Gary will pay out of pocket if he chooses the HDHP Plan, Advantage 10 or Essential 20 Plan, but because of the lower deductible and Out of Pocket maximum in the Essential 20 Plan, the Essential 20 Plan is the lowest-cost plan in this scenario. </p>

              <p>Gary breaks his arm in a bike accident. Physician fees, x-rays, a cast and other items cost $1,200,&nbsp;which are in addition to his standard expenses.</p>
              <p> The Advantage 10 Plan is the lowest cost option thanks to its premium savings compared to the Essential 20 Plan and the Galaxy Health Savings Account contribution, which he doesn’t get with the HDHP Plan Plan.</p>

              <p>Gary has a serious heart attack, and the cost above his standard expenses is very high – about $9,000 for this example.</p>

            <p>Each family member ends up at their primary care doctor’s office once per year for common illnesses. One of the Johnson children sees an allergy specialist once per year and Mr. Johnson takes generic cholesterol medication.&nbsp;Medical expenses for the year total $780.</p>
            <p>Under the Essential 20 and Advantage 10 Plans, they pay nothing out of pocket, as their medical costs are covered by Galaxy contribution into their HSA. Even better, they save $220 that will stay in their HSA for future health needs. Because of its low premium, the HDHP Plan Plan is the lowest cost plan in this scenario.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="desc-3" class="desc-con ds3">
            <p>Mr. Johnson has type 2 diabetes, a condition that requires regular doctor visits, tests and insulin treatment. Their total cost of medical care for the year is an additional $4,000 above their standard expenses. &nbsp;They pay more than twice as much out of pocket with the HDHP Plan Plan, but its premium makes it the lowest cost plan overall. </p>

          <div id="desc-4" class="desc-con ds4">
            <p>A fall off a bike results in a broken arm for one of the Johnson children. Physician fees, x-rays, a cast and other items cost $1,200, which are in addition to his standard expenses.</p>
            <p>The HDHP Plan Plan Out of Pocket costs are the highest but the total cost of this plan is still the lowest because of the premium. The Essential 20 Plan has the lowest Out of Pocket costs due to the lower deductible and the HSA contribution.</p>

          <div id="desc-5" class="desc-con ds5">
            <p>If the Johnsons had accident insurance, his Out of Pocket costs are $586 under the Essential 20 and Advantage 10 plans and reduced greatly under the HDHP Plan Plan. </p>

        <div id="desc-6" class="desc-con ds6">
          <p>Mr. Johnson has a heart attack,  and the cost above their standard expenses is very high – about $9,000 for this example. Along with the other routine family medical costs, their total cost of health care is lowest with the Advantage 10  Plan and slightly higher with the Essential 20 and HDHP Plan plans. </p>
        </div>
          <div id="desc-7" class="desc-con ds7">
            <p>Fortunately, the Johnsons purchased $5,000 in critical illness coverage for about $8 per month (premium rates depend on age and tobacco status). The critical illness benefit is paid to Mr. Johnson directly when he is diagnosed. It covers all of his costs and some is left over for incidental expenses.</p>

  <p><!--Note: all costs are annualized estimates. Your cost will likely be different. Out of Pocket Expenses include deductibles and coinsurance. HSA assumes receipt of both the automatic and wellness incentive contributions. All scenarios assume the Standard care expenses are still part of the equation. Costs assume use of in-network providers. Out-of-network services are more costly and significantly impact the total cost of care.--></p>
