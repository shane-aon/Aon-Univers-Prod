       <h5> People’s United offers employees a competitive package of benefits that includes a choice of health plans,
valuable life and disability insurance, retirement benefits and various wellness and work/life offerings.<br><br>

  <b>As a new employee, you have 30 days following your first day of employment to enroll in the following
benefits:</b></h5><br>


        <ul class="listc">
          
              <li><strong>Medical/Prescription Drug</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Voluntary Accidental Injury, Critical Illness and Hospital Care Insurances</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Dental</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Vision</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Flexible Spending Accounts</strong></li>

        </ul><br>

        <p>Your benefits are important. Be sure you take this opportunity to choose the right benefits coverage for you
and your family. If you miss your new hire enrollment deadline, you will not have People’s United health
care coverage this year. You will not have another opportunity to enroll for People’s United health care
benefits until either the next annual Open Enrollment period (for benefits effective January 1, 2020) or until
you experience a permitted election change event, such as a marriage, birth or adoption.</p><hr>

    Online enrollment is available 24/7 on my-peoples during your new hire enrollment period, so
you can enroll when it is convenient for you. Simply log into my-peoples and go to
Myself>Life Events>I am a new hire. You must elect or decline every benefit listed, and then
click “Submit.” The coverage you elect will take effect on the 1st of the month following your
date of hire.

                People’s United Bank’s Open Enrollment period is just around the corner. Now is the time to consider whether your current benefit elections still meet the needs of you and your family.<br><br>

                <h4>Open Enrollment takes place October 29 through November 12, 2018.</h4><br>

                During this time, you will have the opportunity to learn about your benefit plan options and elect, change or waive benefits coverage for the 2019 plan year. All elections made during Open Enrollment become effective January 1, 2019. If you do not submit elections, your current coverage will end on December 31, 2018, and you will not have coverage through People's United in 2019.<br><br>

                This website describes your benefit options available and actions you must take to enroll during Open Enrollment. Please review it carefully and share it with your family, because you cannot make changes to your elections or newly elect during the year, unless you experience a permitted election change event.<br><br>

                <b>All benefits-eligible employees must actively participate in this year’s Open Enrollment. If you don’t, your current benefit elections will end on December 31, 2018. Once Open Enrollment ends, you will only be able to newly enroll or change your elections if you experience a permitted election change event, such as getting married or having a child.</b><br><br>
