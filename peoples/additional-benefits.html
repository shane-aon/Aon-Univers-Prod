            <h4>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</h4>

           <p>The employee assistance program, available to all employees and their immediate family members, is designed to provide professional help in dealing with personal concerns impacting you and your family at home or at work. You may go online or call for assistance 24/7 with concerns such as marital conflict, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, grief, children’s problems, family budgeting, and legal problems.

           <h4>Paid Time Off (PTO)</h4>
           <p>To allow employees the flexibility to take time off from work for vacation, illness, and personal obligations, People's United provides employees with Paid Time Off (PTO). PTO is an allotment of paid hours that is given to all regular full-time and part-time employees on a calendar year basis beginning on January 1. PTO allotments are based on length of service, job grade level and regularly scheduled work hours. New hires will receive a pro-rated portion of their allotted hours for the remainder of the calendar year in which they were hired on the first of the month following their hire date.  </p>

           <h4>Commuter Benefits</h4>
           <p>Commuter benefits, offered through WageWorks, let all employees pay for eligible commuting costs through
          automatic, pre-tax payroll deduction. People's United subsidizes up to $45 per month for any transit option
          (e.g., bus, train, subway, vanpool, ferry). Parking subsidies are not offered through this program.<br><br>
          You have the option to enroll monthly or set up an automatic reoccurring monthly enrollment. Enrollment must
          be completed by the 4th of the month for the next benefit month (e.g., enroll by June 4 to receive benefit in
          July). Sign up, make changes, or cancel whenever you choose.</p><hr>

          <h4>Tuition Assistance Program</h4>
          <p>Educational benefits in the form of tuition reimbursement are available to eligible employees with one year of
continuous service who are pursuing an associate’s, bachelor’s or master’s degree for an approved major. The
calendar year maximum benefit is $2,400 for full-time employees and $1,200 for part-time employees. People’s
United Bank has also partnered with certain institutions to provide discounts.</p><br>
