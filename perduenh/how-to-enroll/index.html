        <p>
         Enrollment instructions vary depending on location. See your enrollment packet or check with your HR representative for details for your location.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <b>What You'll Need</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="listc">
          <li>Your Associate ID number and badge</li>
          <li>Your date of birth and Social Security number</li>
          <li>Marriage certificates or birth certificates for any dependents with a different last name than yours</li>
          <li>Social Security numbers for any dependents you plan to enroll</li>

        <h4>
          "Opt Out" Option
        </h4>
        <p>
          You also have the option to forego benefit coverage, if you prefer. Perdue allows you to opt out <b>without</b> having to show proof of other coverage. If you choose not to participate in Open Enrollment (for example, by not meeting with a benefits counselor), by default you will be considered declining your coverage for 2018.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <b>As with your other choices, this remains in effect
for the entire plan year, unless you have an approved change in your work or family status.</b>
        </p><br>
        
        
        
        
        <h4>
    Your Eligibility
        </h4>
        <p>
          You are eligible for benefits if you are a full-time associate working 30 or more hours per week and have satisfied your benefits waiting period.
        </p><br>
        
        <h4>
          Dependent Eligibility
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Your eligible dependents may include:</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="listc">
          <li>Your legal opposite-sex or same-sex spouse (unless you are legally separated)</li>
          <li>Your children up to age 26, regardless of marital or student status, even if they are eligible for other insurance coverage</li>
          <li>Your children over age 26 who are physically or mentally disabled may be eligible (see Summary Plan Description for more details)</li>
          <li>Individuals who are neither your spouse nor child(ren) whereby you have legal guardianship</li>
        </ul><br>
        
        <p>
          <b> Dependent Documentation Requirements:</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="listc">
          <li>Birth certificates are required for newborns and dependents with a different last name than yours.</li>
          <li>Statements of Eligibility are required for disabled children.</li>
          <li>A marriage certificate is required for a spouse with a different last name than yours.</li>
          <li>Social Security numbers are required for all dependents.</li>
          <li>Court orders for dependents who are under your guardianship.</li>
          <li>Dates of Birth are required for all dependents.</li>
        </ul><br>
        
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> “Children” include your natural children, stepchildren, children under your legal guardianship and legally
          adopted children. A child may still qualify for coverage
          even though he or she does not reside in your household
          if you are divorced.<br><br>

          Only those dependents meeting the eligibility requirements can enroll for coverage. Check with your benefits counselor or your local Human Resources department for more information regarding dependent eligibility.
          
        </p><br>
        
        <h4>
          Social Security Numbers
        </h4>
        <p>
          Under the healthcare reform law, most U.S. citizens and legal residents are required to obtain qualifying health coverage. Those without appropriate health insurance coverage, and who do not qualify for an exemption, may incur a tax penalty.<br><br>
          
Perdue is required to provide Social Security numbers to the IRS and issue a 1095-C statement to you to verify you are satisfying this requirement under healthcare reform. In order for Perdue to be in compliance, it is a requirement that you provide us with Social Security numbers for yourself and
each dependent you plan to enroll in the Perdue Health Plan.<br><br>
          
This statement is to be filed with your 2017 taxes. The information provided on these statements will be used to substantiate whether or not you were employed full-time, whether you were offered “acceptable” and “affordable” coverage, as well as whether or not you and your dependents enrolled in coverage.<br><br>
During this enrollment process, Perdue has an obligation to remind you of your responsibility to report Social Security numbers to the plan in order to prevent any potential penalties when filing your taxes for 2017.
