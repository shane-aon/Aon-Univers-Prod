        <p>
       There are two traditional PPO medical plans and a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) option to choose from through
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. The Core and Plus traditional PPO medical plans and the HDHP include prescription
drug coverage and require an annual deductible be met before the coinsurance coverage is applied. The premium for the
medical plan and prescription drug coverage appear as one deduction amount on the paycheck. The rates are listed in the
table below.<br><br>

Some important differences between the traditional PPO plans and the HDHP are as follows:

Blue Cross will pay the remaining balance.
You can find important information to help you manage
your pharmacy benefits on Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Texas’s website, <a href="https://www.bcbstx.com/" target="blank">www.bcbstx.com</a>. In addition to helping
