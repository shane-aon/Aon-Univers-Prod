    HSA Bank® —Own Your Health
        </h2>
        
        <p>
         A Health Savings Account (HSA) is an individually owned, tax‐advantaged account that you can use to pay for current or future IRS‐qualified medical expenses.

        </p>

        <h4>
          How to Enroll
        </h4>
        <p>
          Enrollments are completed through the PeopleSoft self-service
portal, <a href="https://psportal.encompasshealth.com">https://psportal.encompasshealth.com</a>.
Once enrollment is processed, HSA Bank will mail a debit
card, followed by the welcome kit.
        </p><hr>
        
        <h4>
          How an HSA Works
        </h4>
          <ul class="listc">
              <li>You can contribute to your HSA via payroll deduction, online banking transfer, or by sending a personal check to HSA Bank. Your employer or third parties, such as a spouse or parent, may contribute to your account as well.
</li>
              <li>You can pay for qualified medical expenses with your health benefits debit card directly to your medical provider or pay out of pocket. You can either choose to reimburse yourself or keep the funds in your HSA to grow your savings.
</li>
              <li>Unused funds will roll over year to year. After age 65, funds can be withdrawn for any purpose without penalty (subject to ordinary income taxes).
</li>
              <li>Check balances and account information via HSA Bank’s member website or mobile device 24/7.</li>

          </ul>

        <hr>

        <h4>Are You Eligible for an HSA? </h4>
        <p>If you have a qualified high deductible health plan (HDHP) –either through your employer, spouse or one you’ve purchased on your own–chances are you can open an HSA. </p>
        <ul class="listc">
            <li>You cannot be covered by any other non-HSA-compatible health plan, including Medicare Parts A & B.</li>

            <li>You cannot be covered by TriCare.</li>
            <li>You cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return (unless it’s your spouse).</li>
            <li>You must be covered by the qualified HDHP on the first day of the month.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h4>What Are the Annual IRS Contribution Limits? </h4>
        <p>Contributions made by all parties to an HSA cannot exceed the annual HSA limit set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Anyone can contribute to your HSA, but only the account holder and employer can receive tax deductions on those contributions. Combined annual contributions for the account holder, employer and third parties (i.e., parent, spouse or anyone else) must not exceed these limits.<sup>2</sup></p>

          How Can You Benefit From Tax Savings? 

        </h4>
        <p>
        An HSA provides triple tax savings.<sup>3</sup></p>

        <ul class="listc">
            <li>Contributions to your HSA can be made with pre-tax dollars and any after-tax contributions that you make to your HSA are tax deductible.</li>
            <li>HSA funds earn interest and investment earnings are tax free.</li>
            <li>When used for IRS-qualified medical expenses, distributions are free from tax.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        
        <h4>
          IRS-Qualified Medical Expenses 

        </h4>
        <p>
         You can use your HSA to pay for a wide range of IRSqualified
medical expenses for yourself, your spouse or
tax dependents. An IRS-qualified medical expense is
defined as an expense that pays for healthcare services,
equipment or medications. Funds used to pay for IRSqualified
medical expenses are always tax free. HSA
funds can be used to reimburse yourself for past medical
expenses if the expense was incurred after your HSA was
established. While you do not need to submit any receipts
to HSA Bank, you must save your bills and receipts for tax
purposes.

        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p><small>Investment accounts are not FDIC insured, may lose value and are not a deposit or other obligation of, or guarantee by the bank. Investment losses which are replaced are subject to the annual contribution limits of the HSA. 2 HSA funds contributed in excess of these limits are subject to penalty and tax unless the excess and earnings are withdrawn prior to the due date, including any extensions for filing Federal Tax returns. Account holders should consult with a qualified tax advisor in connection with excess contribution removal. The Internal Revenue Service requires HSA Bank to report withdrawals that are considered refunds of excess contribu-tions. In order for the withdrawal to be accurately reported, account holders may not withdraw the excess directly. Instead, an excess contribution refund must be requested from HSA Bank and an Excess Contribution Removal Form completed. 3 Federal Tax savings are available no matter where you live and HSAs are taxable in AL, CA and NJ. HSA Bank does not provide tax advice. Consult your tax profes-sional for tax‐related questions. 4 This list is not comprehensive. It is provided to you with the understanding that HSA Bank is not engaged in rendering tax advice. The information provided is not intended to be used to avoid Federal Tax penalties. For more detailed information, please refer to IRS Publication 502 titled, “Medical and Dental Expenses.” Publications can be ordered directly from the IRS by calling 1 800 TAXFORM. If tax advice is required, you should seek the services of a professional. 5 Insurance premiums only qualify as an IRS-qualified medical expense: while continuing coverage under Cobra; for qualified long-term care coverage; cover-age while receiving unemployment compensation; for any healthcare coverage for those over age 65 including Medicare (except Medicare supplemental coverage).</small></p>
