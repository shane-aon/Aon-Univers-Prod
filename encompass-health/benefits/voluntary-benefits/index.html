          Group Hospital Indemnity Insurance*
        </h3>
        <p>
         An unexpected hospital stay, even for a routine procedure,
could force you to dip into your hard-earned savings.
Hospital indemnity insurance can pay you a lump-sum
benefit to help cover the costs associated with a hospital
stay. It can complement your health plan to help with the
out-of-pocket expenses medical insurance may not cover,
such as coinsurance, copays and deductibles. You decide
how to spend the money. Coverage is also available for
your spouse and children.

        </h3>
        <p>
         What’s a critical illness? Heart attack and stroke are a
couple of common examples. This coverage also includes
serious conditions like permanent paralysis, and some
policies can provide coverage for cancer. Treatment for
these conditions can be very expensive, so critical illness
insurance can help–by paying a lump sum directly to you
at the first diagnosis of a covered condition. You decide
how to spend the money, and you can also purchase
coverage for your spouse. Dependent children are
automatically covered at 25% of your benefit amount.

        <p>
          

With the high cost of medical care today, a trip down
the stairs can hurt your bank account as much as your
body. Accident insurance can pay you money based on
the injury and the treatment you receive, whether it’s a
simple sprain or something more serious like a broken
bone. Your plan can pay benefits for emergency room
treatment, stitches, crutches, injury-related surgery and a
list of other accident-related expenses. The money is paid
directly to you and you decide how to spend it. You can
also purchase coverage for your spouse and dependent
children.

        </h3>
        <p>
          
Whole life insurance can pay money to your loved ones
if you die. But, it also offers additional value: a “living”
benefit. If you are diagnosed with a terminal illness
and have a life expectancy of one year or less, you can
request some or all of the death benefit while you are
living. Whole life insurance premiums won’t increase with
age, and your policy can build cash value over time. You
can use the cash value later in life to buy a smaller, “paidup”
policy with no more premiums due.
