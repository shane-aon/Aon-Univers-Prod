          Step Up To Excellence Points
Program
        </h3>
		<p>
        Encompass Health offers you more opportunities to be
recognized and rewarded for exceeding performance
and contributing to Encompass Health’s commitment to
excellence within the healthcare industry. Encompass
Health believes that employees who strengthen our
reputation and goals for excellence deserve recognition.
Some of these actions include - Patient Satisfaction,
Training & Education, Wellness Participation, Safety,
Community Involvement, Teamwork, and Outstanding Employee Achievement Awards. Some examples of points
that may be rewarded to employees for Stepping Up might
include providing patients with an excellent experience and
a positive outcome; fostering an environment of working
together; giving back to the community; or participating in
the company’s wellness programs.<br><br>

Employees may let leadership know when co-workers
go above and beyond by “Nominating a Colleague”
at  <a href="https://www.stepuptoexcellence.com/login" target="blank"> stepuptoexcellence.com</a>. The website also allows
employees to recognize fellow employees with non-points
valued E-certificates to celebrate a birthday, wedding, new
baby or professional accomplishments.<br><br>

Points earned may be redeemed for merchandise, travel,
event tickets and activities. Visit <a href="https://www.stepuptoexcellence.com/login" target="blank"> stepuptoexcellence.
com</a> to view the Rewards Gallery and learn how to earn
points through the programs currently in place. Any
points you earn roll over from year to year, allowing you to
accumulate total points towards items on your wish list.<br><br>

The IRS considers employee recognition awards as
income. As such, you will be taxed on the recognition
points as they are entered and once awarded, the taxes
will be reflected on your paystub after the reporting
period.<br><br>


If you terminate employment with Encompass Health, you
will be able to redeem your points within 90 days of your
last day of employment. If you have not redeemed your
points by that date, a gift card for the equivalent amount
of the points will be mailed to your home address.
