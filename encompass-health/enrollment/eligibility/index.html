      <h2>Eligibility</h2><br>
       
   <h4>When coverage begins</h4>
                <p>Coverage will be effective on the date of eligibility 
                    (hire date/change of status date). Changes to the initial enrollment can be made within the first 31 days of eligibility. The effective date for coverage changes made within the first 31 days of eligibility is the date the form is signed by the employee. </p><hr>

               <h4>When coverage ends</h4>
               <p>Coverage will end on the date an employee terminates employment, the date an employee changes to a non-benefit eligible class or when an employee goes out on a leave of absence.</p><hr>

              <h4>Eligible members</h4>
                <p>Eligible members that you may include in your health insurance coverage are listed below. You must provide proper documentation for each member within two weeks of the coverage effective date (see the Dependent Eligibility Verification section in this booklet). Without proper documentation, your eligible members will not be covered.</p><br>

              <ul class="listc">
                <li>Your legal spouse</li>
                <li>Your same or opposite sex domestic partner, provided he or she meets the domestic partner requirements</li>
                <li>An unmarried or married child* up to age 26</li>
                <li>An unmarried, incapacitated child* who is age 26 and over; is not able to support himself; and depends on you for support, if the incapacity occurred before age 26</li>
              </ul><br>

              <p><small>*A child is defined as your natural child; stepchild; legally adopted child; child placed for adoption; or, other child for whom the employee has permanent legal custody. </small></p><hr>


            <h4>Domestic partners/same-sex spouses</h4>
              <p>For your domestic partner to be covered under the medical plan (including the Prescription Drug Program) and the dental and vision programs, you and your domestic partner must:</p>

              <ul class="listc">
                <li>Consider each other life partners</li>
                <li>Both be age 18 or older</li>
                <li>Not be blood related</li>
                <li>Have lived together for at least 12 months</li>
                <li>Share the same permanent address and provide your driver’s licenses listing the common address</li>
                <li>Have joint responsibility for each other’s welfare and be mentally competent</li>
                <li>Not be legally married to or in a domestic partnership with anyone else</li>
                <li>Not have had another domestic partner within the past six months</li>
                <li>Share necessities of life and financial interdependence</li>
              </ul><br>



              <p>Domestic partners must complete the “Affidavit Declaring Domestic Partnership Status” and submit at least two of the following documents:</p><br>

              <ul class="listc">
                <li>A joint bank account, credit account or loan</li>
                <li>Joint vehicle ownership</li>
                <li>Joint ownership, mortgage or lease of a residence</li>
                <li>Evidence of common household expenses, such as utilities or phone</li>
                <li>Wills naming each other as executor and/or beneficiary</li>
                <li>Granting each other power of attorney</li>
                <li>Designating each other as a beneficiary under a retirement benefit account or evidence of other joint financial responsibility</li>
              </ul><br>

              <p>You must submit a Domestic Partner Affidavit with the specified documentation above to obtain coverage. 
                Unless your domestic partner qualifies as a “dependent” under the Internal Revenue Code, you may be treated 
                as receiving “imputed income” for federal income tax purposes with respect to the benefits provided to your domestic partner. Imputed income is the difference between the value of the benefit provided to your domestic partner and the amount that you have paid for that benefit. You must pay federal income taxes (including Social Security tax and Medicare tax) on your imputed income. Similar treatment may apply for state and local income-tax purposes, to the extent applicable. For more information on federal, state or local taxation of domestic partner or same-sex spouse benefits, please contact your tax advisor.</p><hr>

                <h4>Qualified event changes</h4>
                <p>Changes to benefit elections during the year are permitted only with a “qualifying event.” A qualifying event includes:</p><br>
                <ul class="listc">
                  <li>Marriage</li>
                  <li>Divorce/legal separation or termination of domestic partner status</li>
                  <li>Addition of newborn</li>
                  <li>Death of dependent</li>
                  <li>Court-ordered coverage for dependent child only</li>
                  <li>Dependent child has lost coverage</li>
                  <li>Significant change in health coverage offered to employee and dependent</li>
                  <li>Spouse/domestic partner commencement or termination of employment</li>
                  <li>Change in eligibility of employee or spouse</li>
                  <li>Unpaid leave of absence by employee or spouse</li>
                </ul><br>

                <p>A change in coverage based on one of the reasons above must be made within 31 days of the event. The form needed to complete the change is provided on the Benefits home page.</p><hr>

                <h4>If approved, when the qualifying event change is effective</h4>

                  <p>The effective date of the coverage change will be the date the employee requests the change (based on the date the form is signed). Changes due to marriage, divorce, birth or adoption are effective the date of the actual qualifying event. </p><br>
