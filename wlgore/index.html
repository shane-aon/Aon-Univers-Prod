                                  This plan is a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan, which generally allows you to see any licensed provider but pays a higher benefit in most cases if a provider is used from the PPO network.<br><br>
                                  
If you go to a non-preferred provider, the plan's payment for a service by that non-preferred provider may be substantially less than the amount billed. You are responsible for the difference between the amount the plan pays and the amount billed for non-preferred providers. It is therefore to your advantage to obtain medical and hospital services from preferred providers. 
<br><br>
 <b> Note:</b> Some non-network providers have contracts with Highmark Delaware that limit what they may charge. If you visit such a provider, benefits will still be paid at the out-of-network percentage, but the provider will not bill you more than the allowable charge for the covered service. If you go to a non-preferred provider, be sure to ask whether that provider has such a contract with Highmark Delaware.<br><br>
                                  
<b> Note:</b> All plan benefits are subject to possible exclusions and limitations.

                               The Delta Dental Plan has both a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) network and a Premier Plan network. The plan generally allows you to see any licensed provider, but in most cases pays the highest benefit if you use a PPO provider.<br><br>
                                  
The majority of dentists nationwide are contracted Delta Dental (PPO & Premier) dentists, giving you convenient access to more dentists.

                              Healthcare Flexible Spending Account
                            </h4>

                    			<p>
                             The Healthcare Flexible Spending Account is a tax-free account that allows you to pay for healthcare expenses that are not covered, or are partially covered, by your medical, dental and vision insurance plans. This may include deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance. By contributing a portion of your payroll dollars into your Flexible Spending Account on a pre-tax basis, you can save on the cost of eligible expenses you are already incurring.<br><br>
                                  
When you enroll in a Flexible Spending Account, you decide how much to contribute for the entire Plan Year. The money is then deducted from your paycheck, pre-tax (before Federal & State income taxes and FICA taxes are deducted) in equal amounts over the course of the plan year. After you incur expenses that qualify for reimbursement, you submit claims (reimbursement requests) to request tax-free withdrawals from your Flexible Spending Account to reimburse yourself for these expenses.<br><br>
                                  
If you elect a Healthcare Flexible Spending Account, you will automatically receive a Your Spending Account debit card. The Your Spending Account card can be used to pay for health-related expenses quickly and easily, and is pre-loaded with your election for the year. You may use this debit card to pay for eligible expenses at the doctor’s office, pharmacy and other medical service locations.<br><br>
                                  
You may contribute up to $2,600 for healthcare expenses each calendar year. At any time during the year, you can receive reimbursement from your Healthcare Flexible Spending Account for the full amount you elected.
<br><br>Participants in the Healthcare Flexible Spending account may carry over up to $500 from their accounts into the following calendar year. The carryover funds may be used towards reimbursement of eligible claims in the following calendar year.

Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account

    </h4>
                            <p>
                              The Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account reimburses you for the expenses of day care, nursery school or babysitting that enable you and/or your spouse to work.<br><br>

In order to be reimbursed for dependent care expenses, your dependent must meet one of the following categories:

                            </p>
                            <ul class="listc">
                              <li>Dependent child(ren) under 13 years old</li>
                              <li>Dependent adults who meet the IRS definition of dependency and regularly spend at least eight hours a day at home with you</li>
                              <li>Dependent who is physically or mentally unable to care for himself or herself</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                              When you elect this benefit, you estimate what your total dependent care expenses will be for the calendar and determine the amount that will be deposited in the account.
                            </p>

                   Associates working 20 or more hours per week with at least 90 days of service may take up to four (4) weeks of paid time off per calendar year to care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner. Leave benefits are also available to parents who need time to bond with a new child entering their family by birth, adoption, surrogacy or foster care placement. If the benefit is used to bond with a new child, no additional leave time will be granted under Caregiver Leave for an Associate to care for a seriously family member until the next calendar year.<br><br>

Caregiver Leave must be taken continuously.  It can start on any day of the week, but once leave starts, the total entitlement must be taken without interruption.  If an Associate returns to work before the leave entitlement has been exhausted, the remainder of leave will be forfeited. Any period of leave outside of Unum’s approval period would be covered by an Associate’s personal sick, vacation or unpaid time (with leadership approval).
Caregiver Leave will run concurrently with any applicable federal and/or state leave programs for a maximum of 100% pay. To initiate leave, first inform your leader, then contact Unum (8000-532-9590) and HR Services (1-877-942-7547).

								Business Travel Insurance
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                              The Company has arranged to provide insurance coverage for all Associates who travel on business. This policy would pay $200,000 in death benefits and has a schedule of payments for loss of limbs or sight. It protects any Associate traveling on business from leaving the residence or place of regular employment, until return. This includes travel between plants. There are no territorial limits, nor are there any restrictions on mode of travel, except coverage is not provided if you travel as the pilot, operator or member of the crew of a non-Gore owned or non-Gore leased aircraft. Also, travel to and from work is excluded, as is personal travel in Company cars.

                            Gore provides a floating holiday to regular full and part time Associates to be taken at the Associate’s discretion any time during the calendar year. The number of hours given for the floating holiday are as follows:

                            </p>


                            <ul class="listc">
                                        <li>If your standard work week is five 8 hour shifts, you receive 8 hours.</li>
                                        <li>If your standard work week is four 10 hours shifts, you receive 10 hours.</li>
                                        <li>If your standard work week is three 12 hour shifts, you receive 13.33 hours.</li>
                                        <li>If your standard work week is four 9 hour shifts and one 4 hour shift, you receive 9 hours. NOTE: if you take your floating holiday on the day you normally work 4 hours, you must report 4 hours of floating holiday time, and you forfeit the other 5 hours.</li>
                                        <li>For Part-Time Associates, the hours of the floating holiday are pro-rated based upon the number of hours worked in a standard work week (not shift) – (i.e. for a standard 30 hour work week your floating holiday would be equivalent to 6 hours).</li>
                            </ul><br>

                            <p> You may schedule the floating holiday in advance at any time during the calendar year with notice to your leader. The floating holiday, which must be taken as a whole day, will be lost at the end of the year if not used by December 31st. Gore Temporary Associates are not eligible for the floating holiday. Associates hired after July 1 will not receive the floating holiday for that calendar year.<br><br>


                                Associates who work both the day before and the day after a holiday are eligible for holiday pay. Exception to this guideline which will also entitle the Associate to holiday pay is when the absence is excused (i.e. Time Off Benefits or Protected Leaves of Absence).</p>

            Associates may carry vacation hours over from one service year to the next. The maximum number of vacation hours (core hours + hours carried over) that can be taken in a service year is equal to two times your core vacation. Any unused vacation above this amount will be lost. (Laws in some states may supersede this vacation loss.)

                            You have the option to purchase additional vacation time on a post-tax basis. You may choose to buy from one to five personal vacation days each year. The cost of each personal vacation day is based on your pay.<br><br>

                            In addition, the number of hours of each personal vacation day is based on your regularly scheduled workweek. For example, if you normally work 30 hours a week and buy five days, you are buying 30 hours.<br>

                            <p>Associates have two company funded benefits to support them through an illness - Sick Pay and Short Term Disability. These benefits are for an Associate who suffers a non-work related illness or injury that prohibits him/her from working his/her regular job. Sick pay benefits allow the regular pay to continue, giving the Associate an opportunity to regain his/her health and return to the enterprise without any undue financial burden, and are intended for all uses provided under applicable law for themselves and eligible family members. Sick pay benefits are available only for benefit eligible Associates.</p>

                            Annually, beginning January 1st, Associates will receive 10 sick days (80 hours) that can be used during the calendar year. These days may be used for yourself or for an associate's family member. These days are not accrued and there is no cash value if an associate is separated.<br><br>

                            <b>Eligibility:</b><br>
                            New associates are eligible for sick days according to the following service schedule. Part-time associates' number of hours will be pro-rated by the number of hours worked for the total service year. All other benefit eligible associates will receive 10 sick days (80 hours) per calendar year.

                            <h3>Short Term Disability</h3>

                            <p>Short term disability (STD) is a company-funded benefit for serious illnesses or injuries. Our service provider UNUM must be contacted to receive this benefit. These days are not accruable and have no cash value if an associate is separated. Short Term Disability is used in serious health situations needing extended periods of absence. This benefit is only for an associate's illness or injury, not for a family member.
                                <br><br>

                                <b>Eligibility:</b><br>
                                You are eligible for STD coverage on your first day of regular employment if you are full time or part-time regularly scheduled to work 20 or more hours per week. Once approved by Unum, Associates are eligible for Short Term Disability after a 7 calendar day waiting period during which sick time, vacation or unpaid time may be used. Part-time associates' benefit will be pro-rated by the number of hours worked for the total service year.<br>
                                Associates are eligible for 26 weeks of salary continuance. 100% of base salary earning for the first 8 weeks followed by a benefit equal to 80% of base salary earning for the remaining approved disability duration.<br><br>

                                <p>All company-paid benefits, such as health and life insurance, ASOP, 401(k), etc., will continue while you are on pay continuation. You are responsible for your contributory deductions. If employment with Gore ends, your company-paid benefits end. If you are unable to return to work after the maximum duration is reached (as outlined above), and if you have elected Long-Term Disability Insurance and meet the test for coverage, your LTD benefits may begin at the end of 26 weeks of continuous disability as defined by the LTD plan.<br><br>

                                All associates will be eligible for 26 weeks of salary continuation on first day of employment. 100% of eligible pay for the first 8 weeks and 80% of eligible pay for weeks 9-26.</p>

                                <h3>Long Term Disability</h3>

                                <p>Unum is the carrier for the Long Term Disability (LTD) plan.<br><br>

                                    This plan offers you continuing income if you are unable to work because of a disability. All associates are provided LTD coverage. The Gore-paid benefit is 50% of base salary with an associate voluntary buy up option of 20% of base salary. Total LTD coverage could be 70%. Benefits are reduced dollar for dollar by any disability benefits received from Social Security (family benefits), any state disability plan, workers' compensation, etc. The maximum combined benefit amount is $14,500 per month. The minimum monthly benefit amount is $100 or 10% of your gross disability payment.<br><br>

                                    LTD benefits begin after 26 weeks of eligible continuous disability. In general, benefits may continue until you return to work, no longer qualify for disability, reach maximum period of payment, or die. The 50% Gore paid benefit is a pretax benefit and is treated as taxable income. The 20% voluntary buy up is purchased with after-tax dollars and therefore reduces your tax liability if you become disabled and have to collect this benefit.<br><br>

                                    If your salary increases during the calendar year, your long term disability coverage volume and per pay cost increase as well.<br><br>

                                    There is an elimination period of 180 days before the plan will pay benefits.<br><br>

                                    You would be considered disabled and eligible for benefits when Unum determines that:

                                        <li>You are limited from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to your sickness or injury; and</li>
                                        <li>You have a 20% or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury.</li>

                                    After 24 months of payments, you are disabled when Unum determines that due to the same sickness or injury, you are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.<br><br>

                                    The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification does not, in itself, constitute disability. You must be under the regular care of a physician in order to be considered disabled.<br><br>
                                    <b>Note:</b> The plan may create a rehabilitation program to help return you to work. Failure to work with the prescribed program could result in loss of benefits. Contact Unum Customer Service for more information.<br><br>

                                    <p>
                                        There could be limitations or a reduction to the amount of benefits you are eligible to receive. This could be caused by a pre-existing condition.<br><br>

                                        Unum has determined a pre-existing condition is anything treated in the three (3) months immediately prior to joining the plan (known as the look-back period).<br><br>

                                        A pre-existing condition will not be covered unless a disability caused by it begins at least 12 months after coverage began for the individual.<br><br>

                                        There is a special limitation for conditions that are sometimes called "self-reported."<br><br>

                                        Such conditions in the insurance industry generally include symptoms that cannot be verified using tests or clinical examinations that are accepted as standard medical practice. Some examples of self-reported conditions could be unverifiable pain, fatigue, or loss of energy. Payments for such disabilities under the plan, if approved will be limited to up to <b>24 months</b>.
                                    </p>

                                     <h5><b><u>Maximum Period of Payment</u></b></h5>

                                     <p>The plan has a maximum period of payment, which means the duration of your benefits will depend on your age at the time of your disability. Refer to the chart below for the maximum period of payment.</p>
