                <h4>What is WrapPlan<sup>®</sup>II and why do I need it?</h4>


                  <p> WrapPlan®II flexible premium adjustable life insurance (Universal Life Insurance), is a NYSUT Member Benefits Trust-endorsed program available to all NYSUT members, their spouses/domestic partners and their eligible children. This unique product was designed especially for NYSUT members to "wrap" around your existing term life plan - regardless of whether it is a NYSUT Member Benefits Trust-endorsed policy, employer-provided term or any other term policy - to create a competitive way to offset the inevitable age-related benefit reductions, premium increases, or policy termination due to separation from service. WrapPlan®II  may be structured to increase by 50% when your term life insurance decreases (usually at age 65) or when it terminates, thus restoring full coverage. Example: If you have a $50,000 term policy which decreases by 50% at age 65, you are left with only $25,000 of coverage.  Attempting to convert or purchase additional insurance at this age can be very costly; and, if you have health issues, it may not be possible to obtain insurance at all.  If you purchased a WrapPlan®II policy, your Immediate Coverage Amount would be $25,000 and the Guaranteed Increase Amount, which would take effect when you attain age 65, would be an additional $25,000, providing you with a total coverage amount of $50,000 and restoring your full coverage amount without conversion premiums or additional medical requirements.  Level benefit coverage is also available if you do not have existing term life insurance.</p>

   <h5 class="highlight">Therefore, when you need coverage the most, You will have it ...<br>Without higher premiums, reductions in benefits, and regardless of health status!</h5>
