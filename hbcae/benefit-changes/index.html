                    <h5>UNDERSTAND YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE HAVING SURGERY.</h5>
                    <p>To help you understand your options before having surgery, there is a requirement under HBC’s health plans to participate in Surgery Decision Support (SDS) through ConsumerMedical for FIVE (5) specific surgeries:</b>


                      <ul class="listc">
                        
                        <li>Lower back surgery,</li>
                        <li>Hip or knee replacement,</li>
                        <li>Weight loss surgery, or</li>
                        <li>Hysterectomy</li>
                      </ul><br>
                      <p>

                    If your physician recommends one of these surgeries, you must contact ConsumerMedical for Surgery Decision Support (SDS) before having non-emergency.<br><br>

                    If you, or your covered spouse or domestic partner, complete the SDS requirements, you will avoid $1,000 penalty at the time your claim(s) are processed, unless you have one of these surgeries on an emergency basis. To be eligible for gift card and avoid the penalty, contact ConsumerMedical <b>at least 30 days before</b> the scheduled date for one of the surgeries listed above to engage with ConsumerMedical through completion of a survey.  You do not have to follow ConsumerMedical’s recommendations – the ultimate decision regarding your medical condition remains with you and your physician. <br><br>

                    If you participate in the program for Oncology Support you will receive a $400 HSA contribution from HBC.

  <h4>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ONLINE ENROLLMENT</h4> 

  <p>When enrolling online you must complete the full enrollment process (including printing your confirmation statement) to ensure your elections are what you intended. Any changes you make in the Enrollment System are saved in “real time” meaning- as you make them. <b>Therefore, if you leave the system after any enrollment section, any changes you have made up to that point will be saved. If you do not go back and complete the enrollment process through printing and reviewing your confirmation statement, your incomplete benefit elections will become your final benefit elections for 2019.</b> </p><br><br>
