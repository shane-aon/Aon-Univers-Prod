                <h4>WHO IS ELIGIBLE</h4>
                <p>Regular full-time associates* of J.Crew Group, Inc. — which includes J.Crew and Madewell — are eligible for benefits. You can also cover eligible family members, including your:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Spouse (same or opposite-sex)</li>
                  <li>Domestic partner (same or opposite-sex)</li>
                  <li>Child(ren) up until the last day of the month in which he/she reaches age 26. For this purpose, covered Children include your children or children of your domestic partner.</li>
                </ul>
                <!--<p>Marriage certificate, birth certificate and/or adoption paperwork must be provided to enroll a spouse or child(ren).</p>-->

                <p>Marriage Certificate, Birth Certificate and/or Adoption paperwork must be provided to enroll a spouse or child(ren).<br><br>

                A Declaration of Domestic Partnership form with three proofs must be provided to enroll a domestic partner.<br><br>

                <strong>Enrolling a Domestic Partner</strong> - Due to IRS regulations, you must pay taxes on any amount that J. Crew contributes towards the portion of the medical, dental and vision benefits you receive for your domestic partner and any children of your domestic partner that you cover. Additionally, the payroll deductions which are made throughout the year which pay your share of the premiums for domestic partner coverage will be deducted from your pay on a pre-tax basis, but will be included as imputed income at year end to be reflected on your W-2.<br><br>

                <strong>Spouse/Domestic Partner Surcharge</strong> - If your spouse/domestic partner is eligible for medical coverage through his/her employer and you elect to cover him/her under a J.Crew medical plan, you will incur a $100 monthly surcharge.
                </p>

                <p><small><strong><i>*In general, associates are eligible for benefits if they are regularly scheduled to work at least 30 hours per week. </i></strong></small></p>

                  <h4>WHEN COVERAGE IS EFFECTIVE</h4>
                  <!--<p>Your health care coverage is effective on the first of the month following your date of hire, rehire or status change to regular full-time. You must enroll within 31 days of your coverage effective date to participate in:</p>

                  <ul>
                      <li>Medical, prescription drug, dental and vision coverages</li>
                      <li>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs)</li> 
                      <li>MetLaw (Hyatt Legal Plan)</li>
                  </ul><-->
                     <!--<p>All elections made during this year’s Open Enrollment period become effective January 1, 2019, except for Supplemental Long-Term Disability Insurance, Evidence of Insurability (EOI) is required if you were previously eligible for Long-Term Disability, but electing coverage for the first time or if you are increasing coverage levels. EOI must be approved before the benefit can begin. No Evidence of Insurability (EOI) is needed if you increase your Supplemental or Spouse Life Insurance one (1) level.</p>
                  

                  <p>Your Health Savings Account (HSA) becomes effective on the date you open your account. For the effective dates of your life and disability benefits, see the <a href="life-insurance.html" target="blank" class="link01">Life</a> and <a href="disability-insurance.html" target="blank" class="link01">Disability</a> pages.</p>-->
                  <p>Your health care coverage is effective on the first of the month following your date of hire, rehire or status change to regular full-time. You must enroll within 31 days of your coverage effective date to participate in:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Medical, prescription drug, dental and vision coverages</li>
                    <li>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs)</li>
                    <li>MetLaw (Hyatt Legal Plan)</li>


                  </ul>

                  <p><b>Note:</b> Enrollment received after the first of the month, but still within the 31-day eligibility period, will be retroactively deducted in lump sum from your paycheck.<br><br>

                  Your Health Savings Account (HSA) becomes effective on the date you open your account. For the effective dates of your life and disability benefits, see the Life and Disability sections on pages 17 and 18.</p>

                <h4>LEVELS OF COVERAGE</h4>
                <p>You can choose from the following levels of coverage for your medical, prescription drug, dental and vision coverages:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Associate Only</em></li>
                  <li><em>Associate + Spouse/Domestic Partner</em></li>
                  <li><em>Associate + Child(ren)</em></li>
                  <li><em>Associate + Family</em></li>
                </ul>
               
                <h4>MAKING CHANGES DURING THE YEAR</h4>
                <p>
                  If you have a qualifying life event during the year – such as a birth, adoption, marriage or divorce, loss of coverage under another plan or if a dependent is no longer eligible – you must contact Human Resources and submit your benefit change(s) within 31 days of the event. This is the only time outside of the Open Enrollment period when you can change your benefits. If you do not enroll within 31 days, you must wait until the next Open Enrollment period to enroll.
                </p>
